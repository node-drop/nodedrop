/**
 * Core Credential Definitions
 * 
 * These are reusable credential types that can be used across multiple nodes.
 * Instead of each custom node defining its own OAuth2 or HTTP Basic Auth,
 * they can reference these core credentials.
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - No duplication of credential definitions
 * - Consistent authentication across nodes
 * - Easier maintenance and updates
 * - Users can reuse the same credentials across multiple nodes
